  <td width="25%"><p><img src="/static/movie_month.jpg" align="left" border="1" alt="Movie of the month"/>The most awaited movie of the summers has finally hit the silver screen, and what a reception! Boasting of the highest ever weekend gross in the history, audience have arguably accepted the pre-oscar talks of Heath Ledger's (R.I.P.) Oscar nomination. Though there we dubious claims of the Oscar talks being mainly based on the post-demise of Heath, movie pundits have no second thoughts on Heath's astonishing performance portraying the very own; in-your-face fiend - The Joker.
<p>
As per the latest superhero movie trends, the emotional side and the humane perspective wraps the high-energy super lashes and fights; picturized with the gigantic IMAX cameras.
</p>
<p>The latest superhero perspective has been very well received by the audiences across the globe; with the cash flow in access of $158 Mils over the weekend bears the testimony. The Dark Knight (TDK), when comapred to the other comic-adaptation scores definitely more than cent percent on every scale; most important being, in my opinion, the casting.
</p>
</p>
<p>As per the latest review on IMDB:</p>
<em>
<p class="style2">"All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing."</p>
